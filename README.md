# UtiliPy Scripts
A collection of some *Utility Python scripts* that I created for hacking my way out of a boring manual task or for trying something cool! :nerd_face:

If they come of any use to you, do leave a star - I'll be happy know!


## An overview
Following are the scripts that I cared to make presentable :sweat_smile:, hoping they'll help you too:

:computer_mouse: [Colour & Coordinate Picker](Color%20Coordinate%20Picker) - Display the coordinates & color of any pixel of the screen, where mouse is pointing to!

:tv: [Movie Subtitle Filename Changer](Movie%20Subtitle%20Filename%20Changer) - Changes the subtitle filenames to same as corresponding movie filenames so that subtitle file is automatically added while playing movie.

:scissors: [PDF Trimmer](PDF%20Trimmer) - Deletes pages from a PDF with redundant content (most likely, due to being generated from a presentation with animated slides)
